Installing mpdscribble
----------------------

See the INSTALL file.


Rating / Love
-------------

With MPD 0.17 or later, clients can submit track ratings over the
client-to-client protocol.  To do that, the client sends the following
command to mpd:

 sendmessage mpdscribble love

The song that is currently playing will be rated with the "love"
attribute, as soon as it gets submitted to the scrobbler.

FM4 Patch
---------

This fork of the original mpdscribble aims to detect streams of the
FM4 readio station, correct the scrambled tag and thus enable
mpdscribbler to send the correct infos to last.fm/libre.fm.

FM4 is a radio station at the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF).
There are tags embedded in the official stream but unfortunatally
all information is encoded in the title tag.
